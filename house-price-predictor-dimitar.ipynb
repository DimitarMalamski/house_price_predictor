This example, though perhaps not the best model in the world, is rather simple and serves as an easy way of getting started with PyTorch Lightning. Here we create a simple feedforward neural network. The model consists of two layers defined in a sequential manner. First, we have a linear layer that takes in the features and transforms them into 64 nodes. This is followed by a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function, which introduces non-linearity to the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns. Finally, the output layer reduces the 64 nodes down to a single output, making this model suitable for regression tasks where we want to predict a single, however, continuous variable. "

    "The histogram shows that most prediction errors fall below approximately `$5,000`, indicating reasonable performance for the majority of houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the distribution is right-skewed, with a small number of large errors exceeding `$10,000`. These extreme errors disproportionately influence the RMSE due to the squared error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that the model performs consistently for mid-range properties but struggles with extreme or high-priced houses."

    "While absolute errors show the magnitude of prediction mistakes, residuals (truth − prediction) reveal whether the model systematically over/under-predicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a well-fitted regression model, residuals should be randomly distributed around zero without clear patterns. Any visible structure may indicate missing relationships or model bias."

    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual plot shows that most residuals are centered around zero, indicating no strong overall bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the spread of residuals increases for higher predicted prices, suggesting `heteroscedasticity` — the model's prediction variance grows for more expensive houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, several large positive residuals indicate systematic underprediction of high-priced properties. This suggests that, although overall predictive performance is strong, the model has increased uncertainty when estimating extreme price values. This behavior is consistent with the capped upper range (medv = 50) and limited representation of high-priced houses in the dataset."

    "# Model Improvement Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Attempt 1: Logarithmic Transformation of the Target\n",
    "\n",
    "Because residual analysis suggested increasing variance for higher-priced houses ( heteroscedasticity ), a logarithmic transformation of the target variable was tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained on log(medv), and predictions were transformed back to the original scale using the exponential function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although log transformations often stabilize variance in regression tasks, performance in original price space deteriorated when evaluated using RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "This occurs because minimizing squared error in log space does not guarantee minimized squared error in the original scale, and exponentiation can amplify small log-space errors into large absolute deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the degradation in performance, this transformation was `not adopted` for the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Attempt 2: Feature Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are highly sensitive to feature scale because gradient updates depend on input magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Boston dataset contains features with vastly different ranges (e.g., tax vs rm vs crim), which can destabilize training and bias gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we applied `standardization` to the input features using `StandardScaler`, fitted only on the training set \n",
    "to prevent `data leakage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "After feature scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- R² improved from to 0.773\n",
    "- RMSE decreased from 5.7 to 4.4 ($1000s)\n",
    "- Residual variance reduced\n",
    "- Error distribution became more concentrated\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms that feature standardization significantly `improves` neural network performance in this regression task.\n"

    "## Final Performance Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of performance estimates were obtained in this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Train-Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Network:\n",
    "- R² ≈ 0.77\n",
    "- RMSE ≈ 4.41 ($1000s)\n",
    "\n",
    "These results were obtained from one specific 60/30/10 split of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "While informative, a single split can produce optimistic or pessimistic results depending on how the data is partitioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Validated Estimate (Preferred)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using 5-fold cross-validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Network:\n",
    "- Mean R² ≈ 0.846\n",
    "- Std R² ≈ 0.044\n",
    "- Mean RMSE ≈ 3.53 ($1000s)\n",
    "- Std RMSE ≈ 0.48\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression:\n",
    "- Mean R² ≈ 0.715\n",
    "- Mean RMSE ≈ 4.84 ($1000s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation provides a more robust and statistically reliable estimate of model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the cross-validated results (R² ≈ 0.846) should be considered the primary performance estimate of the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "An R² of approximately 0.85 indicates that roughly 85% of the variation in house prices can be explained by the selected features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RMSE of approximately $3,530 suggests that, on average, predictions deviate from true prices by about $3,500.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the average house price in the dataset is around $23,000, this corresponds to an average error of roughly 15%, which is strong performance for this dataset size and feature set."

    "## Distributional Assumptions in Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical linear regression assumes that residuals are normally distributed and exhibit constant variance ( homoscedasticity ) for valid statistical inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, predictive performance itself does not strictly require normal residuals. Neural networks, in particular, make no distributional assumptions about residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, analyzing the distribution of the target variable and residuals helps diagnose instability, heteroscedasticity, and systematic bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore examine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution of the target variable (medv)\n",
    "- The distribution of residuals"
